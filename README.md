# petri-net-decomposer

*Petri Net Decomposer* is an application for working with Petri nets, a minimalist editor capable of simple structural analysis.

The app was written as a coursework in 2014, so unfortunately it isn't maintained.
Even though, it does contain some neat graph algorithms, like Kosaraju's, force-directed layout (or rather, my attempt at it) and finding circuits, handles and bridges (described in [this](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-53863-1_27) paper). So feel free to use it whatever way you want.
